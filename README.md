YOU MUST CHECK fingerguns.overlay TO ENSURE THE PROPER PHYSICAL LAYOUT IS CHOSEN

Please see the comments on line 4 of fingerguns.overlay.  In the 'chosen' node, you will need to adjust zmk,physical-layout depending on if you are using the 12 column variant or the 10 column variant of the Fingerguns PCB.

The 12 column is represented by &layout_12col
The 10 column is represented by &layout_10col


YOU MUST SELECT OR CREATE AN APPROPRIATE KEYMAP

In the ergomech community a keymap is an intensely personal thing.  That being said, I've included my own 12 column and 10 column keymaps in case you need somewhere to start.  Please note that fingerguns.keymap is intended for the 10 column variant.  A 12 column keymap is also included under the name fingerguns.keymap.12col.  If you wish to use 12 columns, simply append '.10col' to the default keymap and delete '.12col' from the other one.

If you build more than one, you can change the default bluetooth name in fingerguns.conf.
